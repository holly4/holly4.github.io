  "body": "### Welcome to my GitHub Page.\r\nThis site contains useful code snippets to improve your experience on the Fox Forum. To use them you need to know how to run code in the console tools of your browser. I'll not explain that here, but just google, \"How to open the console in XXX\", where XXX is your browser name, i.e., chrome, for example.\r\nIf you use chrome you should also investigate how to use chrome snippets. Snippets let you have code saved in Chrome and then you can just select to run them. Again, google is your friend\r\n\r\n### What is Github? \r\nGithub is a free (if you share the code else you pay for it) repository of source code in the Internet. I'd guess it's the largest. Most large open source projects use it as well as most student developers. It lets you store the code for a project, and with versioning which is really, really  important to developers, and allows others to easily access that code using a developer tool called git that was created decades ago to control the linux source code.\r\n\r\n### What are Gists?\r\nGists are small snippets of code hosted on github. (I think they named it after... you get the gist of it?). Each of the items mentioned below are saved as a separate Gist. \r\n\r\n### Future Plans\r\nYou probably say, \"That's way annoying. Every time I go to a Fox Forum page I have to run this code?\". \r\nYes, at present, but I don't as I use a windows application developed using Selenium and C# that let's me select an account and then opens chrome in an isolated session just for that account and runs the code snippets here. (It also does a few other things... :).\r\nSoon I'll post a simpler version of that for C# coders to play with. \r\nEventually I plan on writing a Chrome Extension for others.\r\n\r\n### Showing Who Liked Posts\r\nThis is may favorite little snippet. And it's only one line!\r\nLivefyre is already recording who likes comments on the page; they are just not enabled to be displayed. This little snippet just enables those to be shown. Since it's so short I'll repeat it here:\r\n\r\n`$('head').append('<style> div.fyre span.fyre-comment-like-imgs { display: inline; } </style>');`\r\n\r\n",
